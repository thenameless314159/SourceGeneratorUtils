# Introduction

In my journey of implementing [source generators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview), I noticed recurrent similarities in each project. Handling source generation on nested types, for example, appeared frequently. Rewriting this logic on every source generator felt redundant and time-consuming, prompting me to abstract and manage most of these routine writing tasks. Hence, SourceGeneratorUtils was created. 

The main objective is to enable developers to dive straight into writing the code necessary for their source generators, instead of handling the boilerplate writing logic for namespaces, containing types etc.. With **SourceGeneratorUtils**, users can supply an implementation of [`AbstractGenerationSpec`](https://github.com/thenameless314159/SourceGeneratorUtils/blob/main/src/SourceGeneratorUtils/AbstractGenerationSpec.cs) that could be mapped from Roslyn's [`ISymbol`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.codeanalysis.isymbol?view=roslyn-dotnet-4.6.0) (for source generators) or some parsed files with type definitions (for general purpose). Users can then focus on implementing [`SourceCodeEmitter<TSpec>`](https://github.com/thenameless314159/SourceGeneratorUtils/blob/main/src/SourceGeneratorUtils/SourceCodeEmitter.cs)s with logic specific to the target code to generate.
